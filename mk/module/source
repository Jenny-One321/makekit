##     refers to the Unmodified Program or the portion thereof from which

##     addressed as "you."

##  2. As a special exception to the terms of the GNU General Public License,
##     you are granted unlimited permission to copy, distribute, and modify
##     the output of the Program, even when such output contains portions
##     of the Program source code which are otherwise governed by the terms
##     of the GNU General Public License.  When distributing a modified
##     version of the Program, you may choose to extend this special
##     exception to your modified version as well.
## 
##  3. The exception in clause 2 applies only to portions of the Program which
##     appear in a file containing these additional clauses.  You may not
##     extend this exception to portions of the Program which are contained
##     in a file that does not contain these clauses.  In addition, you may
##     not extend the exception to your modified version under any of the
##     following circumstances:
## 
##     a)  You move, copy, combine, or otherwise modify portions of the
##         Program such that a file is produced which:
##         
##         i.  Contains portions of the Program which, in the Unmodified
##             Version, were contained in a file which contained these
##             additional clauses; and
## 
##         ii. Contains portions of the Program which, in the Unmodified
##             Version, were contained in a file which did not contain these
##             additional clauses.
## 
##     b)  You modify the behavior of the Program such that it may copy portions
##         of the Program into its output where said portions, in the Unmodified
##         Version, were contained in a file which did not contain these clauses.
## 
##  4.  If any of the circumstances in clause 3 apply, you must remove these clauses
##      from the affected portions of your version of the Program in order to
##      distribute it.  In the case of (3.i), this means the offending file which
##      contains the inappropriately combined portions of the Program.  In the case
##      of (3.ii), it means the entirety of the Program.
