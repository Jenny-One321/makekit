{"name":"MakeKit","tagline":"A POSIX shell build system","body":"MakeKit\r\n=======\r\n\r\nMakeKit is a new build system for Linux and UNIX that lets you write build rules in pure POSIX shell script. It can be used as a replacement for automake/autoconf/libtool to build a standalone source project. Multiple interdependent projects can be seamlessly integrated into one build.\r\n\r\nFeature Highlights\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- **One build script, one language**\r\n\r\n  Write your build scripts in plain POSIX shell -- MakeKit will generate a Makefile for you. No m4, no separate files for configure checks and build rules with different syntaxes.\r\n  \r\n- **Simple system requirements**\r\n\r\n  MakeKit only requires a standard POSIX environment to run.\r\n  \r\n- **Flexible project structure**\r\n\r\n  Use a single flat build file or a hierarchy of snippets split across subdirectories\r\n  \r\n- **Optimized for parallel building**\r\n\r\n  MakeKit does a single configuration pass and generates a single global Makefile regardless of how many discrete subprojects are present in your build. This lets you efficiently saturate all your CPU cores with work.\r\n\r\nManual\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe [manual](manual) has detailed instructions for setting up a project and a command reference.\r\n\r\nProject\r\n=======\r\n\r\nVisit the [github project page](https://github.com/bkoropoff/makekit) for more information.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
